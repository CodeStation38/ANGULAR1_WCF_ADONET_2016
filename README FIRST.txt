WHAT'S THIS APPLICATION ABOUT?

This application was a Service-Oriented-Architecture based CRM Angular Single Page Application. It featured a responsive UI for frontend and a robust backend with Microsoft WCF-based Services with BasicHttpBinding contracts, ADO.NET, Repository Patterns, Stored Procedures and ADO.NET Helper classes. SQL Server was used as Database. It consisted of two projects:

DEMO Angular 1 API: This was an Angular Single Page Application created with the 
  Visual Studio 2013 template. 

ServicePagoAutomaticoManager: WCF Service-Oriented-Architecture project which 
    handled all the CRUD operations and the Domain logic for this CRM.

HOW TO RUN IT LOCALLY?

This is an example of the type of projects I worked with, related to Angular 1. You may not be able to run this application. The intention is to give you an idea about the work experience I have related to this technology back in 2016. I wrote these examples in my free time. These examples do not belong to the companies I worked for, so there are no data privacy or copyright issues.

Highlights:

    - It was based on the ASP.NET MVC template and added some interesting folders and files like 

    "\\DEMO Angular 1 API\WebApplication\Scripts" 

    which contained all the Angular application itself.

    - Other interesting feature was the folder 
        "\\DEMO Angular 1 API\WebApplication\Areas"

        which was intended to hold a large number of Controllers and Views.
